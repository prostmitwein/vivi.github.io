VIVI Music - Website Documentation

1. Project Overview
-------------------
VIVI Music is a modern, high-performance website for the VIVI Music YouTube Music client.
The site features a dynamic "Material You" aesthetic, smooth animations, and a responsive design.
It is built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with no external framework dependencies.

2. File Structure
-----------------
- index.html: The main structure of the website.
- style.css:  Contains all styling, variables, and animations.
- script.js:  Handles logic for the theme toggle, custom cursor, scroll animations, and API data fetching.
- assets/:    Directory for images and other static media.

3. Setup Instructions
---------------------
This is a static website. No build process is required.
To run it locally:
1. Open the folder in VS Code or any text editor.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
   OR
   Use a local server (e.g., Live Server extension) for better performance with fetch requests.

4. Customization Guide
----------------------
Colors:
Modify the CSS variables in the `:root` section of `style.css` to change the color scheme.
Example:
--accent-pink: #FFB7CD;
--accent-purple: #E0C8FF;

Images:
Replace images in the `assets/` folder. Ensure filenames match those referenced in `index.html` or `script.js`.

Content:
- News: Fetched dynamically from the GitHub repository (`news/` folder).
- Contributors: Fetched dynamically from the GitHub repository contributors list.

5. Performance Optimizations
----------------------------
- Scroll Animations: Uses `IntersectionObserver` for efficient, jank-free revealing of elements.
- Device Detection: Automatically disables heavy effects (like the custom cursor and tilt) on mobile devices.
- Asset Loading: Images use `loading="lazy"` to improve initial load time.
